# SSH access for JustVoxel installation

This guide is for users who want to install an SSH public key into a JustVoxel installer ISO.

You do not need SSH to understand or operate JustVoxel, but SSH is the normal remote terminal access method for an appliance installed on another machine or VM.

## Public key and private key

An SSH key pair has two parts:

- a **private key** that stays on your own computer
- a **public key** that may be copied to servers and installation media

Only the public key belongs in the JustVoxel ISO Builder.

Never upload, paste, or commit your private SSH key to GitHub, an installer repository, an ISO, or another public location.

Common OpenSSH key files look like this:

```text
~/.ssh/id_ed25519      private key - keep this secret
~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  public key - safe to copy to a server
```

The `.pub` file is the one JustVoxel needs.

## Check whether you already have a key

### Linux or macOS

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ls ~/.ssh/*.pub
```

If you see a file such as `id_ed25519.pub`, you may already have a usable public key.

To display it:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

A normal Ed25519 public key starts with `ssh-ed25519`.

### Windows PowerShell

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem $HOME\.ssh\*.pub
```

If `id_ed25519.pub` exists, display it with:

```powershell
Get-Content $HOME\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
```

## Create a new Ed25519 key

If you do not already have a key you want to use, create one with OpenSSH.

### Linux or macOS

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Accept the normal file location unless you have a reason to use a custom path.

OpenSSH may ask for a passphrase. A passphrase protects the private key if somebody gets access to the key file. Whether to use one is your decision, but the private key itself must always remain private.

After generation, copy the contents of the `.pub` file, not the private-key file.

## Add the public key to the ISO Builder

The current JustVoxel ISO workflow can read one public SSH key from a GitHub Actions repository secret named:

```text
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY
```

In the repository that runs the ISO workflow:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Open **Secrets and variables -> Actions**.
3. Under **Repository secrets**, choose **New repository secret**.
4. Name the secret `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`.
5. Paste the complete public key as the value.
6. Save the secret.

The value should be a single OpenSSH public-key line, for example:

```text
ssh-ed25519 AAAA... your-comment
```

The workflow validates the key with OpenSSH before building the installer. If SSH-key installation is enabled but the secret is missing or invalid, the workflow fails instead of producing an installer with an unusable access configuration.

## Select SSH access when building the ISO

When running **Build JustVoxel installer ISO**, enable the workflow option that installs the SSH public key.

The workflow currently supports password login, SSH-key login, or both. It refuses a configuration that would create no usable login method.

The installed default administrative user is:

```text
voxel
```

## Connect after installation

Find the JustVoxel machine's IP address from your router, hypervisor, or local console, then connect from a computer that has the matching private key.

Normally:

```bash
ssh voxel@SERVER_IP
```

If your private key uses a custom filename and is not loaded into an SSH agent:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private-key voxel@SERVER_IP
```

On Windows PowerShell the normal command is the same:

```powershell
ssh voxel@SERVER_IP
```

## If SSH warns after reinstalling JustVoxel

A fresh installation creates a new SSH host identity.

If you reinstall JustVoxel on a machine that keeps the same IP address, your client may warn that the remote host identification has changed. If you intentionally reinstalled that machine and have verified that you are connecting to the correct IP, remove the old saved host key and connect again.

Linux, macOS, and Windows OpenSSH clients can use:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R SERVER_IP
```

Then reconnect and review the new host-key prompt before accepting it.

## Security boundary

The ISO Builder needs only your public key.

Your private key is not needed to build the ISO, is not installed into JustVoxel, and should never be stored in a GitHub secret for this workflow.

The same principle applies to every JustVoxel installation: distribute the public key, protect the private key.
