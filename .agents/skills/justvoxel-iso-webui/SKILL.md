# JustVoxel ISO WebUI

Keep Anaconda WebUI as the installer foundation. Customize only the pieces JustVoxel actually needs.

## Upstream First

The v2 installer builds a pinned upstream Anaconda WebUI and applies narrow JustVoxel overrides.

Preserve this model:

- keep upstream source/version pins intentional and reviewable;
- do not vendor the entire upstream project;
- do not fork/reimplement Anaconda's installer logic unnecessarily;
- keep distro/runtime integration supplied by packaged Anaconda/Cockpit where possible;
- replace only the compiled/source pieces required by the approved JustVoxel customization.

When changing the patch, inspect the pinned upstream source that the patch applies to.

Do not assume an upstream component/API still looks the same after changing pins.

## Wizard Scope

The WebUI should simplify installation, not become a second installer engine.

Use JustVoxel pages and wording for appliance-specific choices such as edition and login information.

Do not duplicate storage, bootloader, network, or account engines in React when Anaconda already provides those capabilities.

Keep unavailable editions explicitly disabled/unavailable. Never make a disabled VM option secretly install HWS or vice versa.

## Storage UI

Preserve upstream storage validation, warnings, and editor behavior.

JustVoxel may expose a smaller set of scenarios, but those choices should invoke upstream storage mechanisms.

Automatic appliance installation may use the approved whole-disk path.

Manual partitioning should reuse the upstream storage editor and its confirmation/validation/return flow.

Do not invent duplicate technical storage scenarios as JustVoxel radio options merely because upstream has them internally.

## Human Experience

Use plain installer language.

The user should understand:

- which JustVoxel edition is being installed;
- which installation method is selected;
- whether a disk may be erased;
- how they will log in after install;
- what will happen when they start installation.

Avoid Linux implementation jargon unless it is necessary for an advanced/manual storage screen.

Branding should remain restrained and readable. Do not sacrifice installer clarity for visual customization.

## Files to Inspect

Typical v2 WebUI work touches:

- `installer-v2/webui-overrides/justvoxel.patch`
- `installer-v2/webui-overrides/src/`
- `installer-v2/webui-overrides/README.md`
- `installer-v2/branding.css`
- `installer-v2/firefox-userChrome.css`
- installer branding/logo/Plymouth assets where relevant

Use `justvoxel-iso-installer` as a supporting skill when a UI change also changes real installer behavior or payload/storage semantics.
